weather-on-df3120
=================

Using the **Parrot DF3120 320x240 Bluetooth/SD/USB Picture Frame** as weather display.

Works now with my Galaxy S3 per Bluetooth.

And, what you will get!

This project was mostly inspired by [repurpose_linux](https://sites.google.com/site/repurposelinux/df3120).
This guys have done a really excellent work. Many thanks again!

And even many thanks to [Attila Sukosd](https://github.com/atiti)!
His [framework](https://github.com/atiti/df3120-sdl-framework) enables me to carry out my ideas.

So and the smallest part of inspiration comes from an other project of mine :
[weather-on-kindle4nt](https://github.com/ufuchs/weather-on-kindle4nt/releases)

On the DF3120 the four day forecast shown on the Kindle is realized with the left and the right button at the rear.
So it's possible to navigate between the 4 daily forecasts.

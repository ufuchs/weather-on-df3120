Use the **Parrot DF3120 320x240 Bluetooth/SD/USB Picture Frame** as weather display.

Works now with my Galaxy S3 per Bluetooth.

And what you will get!

The project would not exist without the help of 

- https://sites.google.com/site/repurposelinux/df3120 This guys have done a really excellent work. Many thanks again!

The application framework were given by :
https://github.com/atiti/df3120-sdl-framework
His framework enables me to carry out my ideas. And even many thanks to Attila Sukosd!

So and the smallest part of inspiration comes from an other project of mine :
https://github.com/ufuchs/weather-on-kindle4nt/releases

On the DF3120 the four day forecast shown on the Kindel is realized with two buttons at the rear.
So it's possible to navigate between the 4 daily forecasts.

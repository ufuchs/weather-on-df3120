weather-on-df3120
=================

Use the **Parrot DF3120 320x240 Bluetooth/SD/USB Picture Frame** as weather display.

Works now with my Galaxy S3 per Bluetooth.

And what you will get!

This project was mostly inspired by 'repurpose_linux' at

This guys have done a really excellent work. Many thanks again!

And even many thanks to Attila Sukosd!

His framework enables me to carry out my ideas.

So and the smallest part of inspiration comes from an other project of mine :
https://github.com/ufuchs/weather-on-kindle4nt/releases

On the DF3120 the four day forecast shown on the Kindel is realized with two buttons at the rear.
So it's possible to navigate between the 4 daily forecasts.

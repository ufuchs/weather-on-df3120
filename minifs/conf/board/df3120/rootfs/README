[files]

/usr/local/bin/fetchWeather.sh

Used to fetch the weather images from the server.
Maybe /or/ better certainly, you have to make some adjustments for your personal environment.


Running `crond`
-------------------

Enable `crond` and `crontab` in the busybox configuration.

See: 'http://www.acmesystems.it/58' for your orientation. At paragraph 'Configure Busybox'.

     And please don't choose this 'dc'. 
     It's an arbitrary precision calculator!

[files]

/etc/cron.d/crontabs/root

Be aware! 
  1.Always edit your crontab with `crontab -e -c /etc/cron.d/crontabs/`.
    Don't use any other editor!
  2.Invoke `crond` per `crond -c /etc/cron.d/crontabs/`.
